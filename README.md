# Mundane Blaster ![Mundane Blaster](favicon.png)

**Mundane Blaster** is a 2D browser game built using Phaser 3, created for the [Dev.to Community Web Game Challenge](https://dev.to/). This project started as a way to learn more about Phaser and web game development, with the initial foundation based on a tutorial, but I try to make it unique.

## Demo
